x Ι INTRODUOTION.

above all, Julius Caesar claimed connection with Iulus,
the son of AEneas, and his watohword at Pharsalia
was Venus Victrix, in reference 1ο his supposed lineage.
According to one legend, the very name Rome was derived
from Ρώμη, 1 Trojan woman who burned 1111 ships of
some Trojan colonists in Latium to prevent their return.
To ossist the tradition there was an old Roman word troia,
meaning “a sow with young;” and another, 11111111,
“aRomanlrnight.'’ The Da' mopsi, moreover, or Percotes,
were easily identified with the θεοὶ μεγάλοι 11 the Troad.
again, 1111 connection between (lumae in Campania, and
Cyme in AEolis, acted in 1111 same manner, especially as
the Sibyllino books which contained references to AEneas
were brought from (lumae to Rome.

⁸The connection with Sicily has less foundation No
doubt, after the first Punic War‚ the Romans and Siciliane
perooived aolose affinity between themselves3 and this
feeling found sanction in 1111 poems 11 Stesichorus, par-
ticularly in the Ἰλίου tripos, in which AEneas and his
orew are ,mentioned as leaving Sicily for Italy. In
Thucydides vi. 2 also, we are told that the people of
Egesta claimed Trojan origin.

The connection with Ocrttopc has more ofa poetic
than historic basis Vergil wished, as Naevius before him,
in his poem on the Punic war, to find a reason for the
mutual animosity existing between the two empireo, and
accordingly he gave 1 significauce to 1111 parting of AEneas
from Dido, prophetia of the struggle between the two
> oonntries in later days.
