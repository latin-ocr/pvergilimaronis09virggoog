INTRODUOTION. xv

The Troy of Homer and Vergil is the third city from
the base. It was built on the ruins of the second city
after a long period of desertion One main difference
between the third city and the others is that while its
predecessore were built of limestona, it was of briola And
this briok bears very distirmt traces of a great conflagra

tion In many cases it is reduced to a shapeless lump;
in others tha surface is vitrified On the east side the
signs cf heat are most apparent, and the smolre has pene
trated and discoloured the interstices between tha courses
of brioks The ruins after the burning of the city raised
the sito nearly ten feet, and this in itseli is evidence of
the magnitude of the conflagration. Tha bricks were
larger than bricks are now,-they werea foot in length
and breadth, and four inches thick

The remains discovered aro very numerous, and a few
only can be alluded to here. The Trojano were evidently
considerable consumere of conchylia. Immense numbers
of shall-bsh and oyster-shells have been found The
bones, too, of sheep, goats, and horses are very frequent,
but not of oren, strange to say„ A quantity of burnt
grain was also discovered among the ruina

At the north-west of the Scaean gata clear traca re
mains of Priam's Palace. In front of it lies an open
space, probably the Agora. Tho palace was not so
magnificent as Vergil (AEa ii. 503), in imitation of Homer,
supposes it to have been In Homer's time the Troy of
poetry was under amass of ruin, and fine buildings of
pohshed stone were probably to be seen in its stead
